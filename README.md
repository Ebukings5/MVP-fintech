Project Overview
The Personal Finance Management App is designed to help users track their income, expenses, manage budgets, and generate financial reports. The app includes user authentication, secure transactions management, budgeting tools, and notifications for bill payments or budget limits.

Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and password reset using JWT tokens.
Transaction Management: Add, update, delete, and view financial transactions.
Budgeting: Set up budgets and track expenses against them.
Income Tracking: Monitor income from different sources.
Notifications: Get alerts for upcoming bills, budget limits, or unusual spending patterns.
Reports and Analytics: Visual summaries of spending, savings, and budget adherence.
Data Import/Export: Support for importing and exporting data in CSV or Excel format.
Technologies Used
Backend:
Django (Python)
PostgreSQL (Database)
Celery (Background task management)
Redis (Task queue backend)
Frontend:
React (JavaScript)
Infrastructure:
Docker (Containerization)
Nginx (Web server)
Gunicorn (App server)
APIs:
Django REST Framework (DRF) for API endpoints.
JWT for user session management.
Architecture
The architecture includes:

DNS: Routes users to the appropriate server.
Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple servers for high availability.
Web Server: Serves the frontend.
App Server: Processes backend logic and API requests.
Cloud Storage: Stores user data securely.
Backend (Django): Core logic, API integration, and business rules.
Database (PostgreSQL): Data persistence layer.
Task Queue (Celery): Handles background jobs and notifications.

Load Testing
Use tools like Apache JMeter or locust to simulate multiple users.

Deployment
Set up your server (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean).
Configure environment variables.
Use Docker for containerization:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
Set up a reverse proxy using Nginx.
Configure Gunicorn as the WSGI server.
Monitor server and app performance using tools like New Relic or Prometheus.
